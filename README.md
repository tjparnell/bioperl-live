# Minimal BioPerl

**WARNING** This is a minimal, bare-bones, stripped-down version of the full 
BioPerl package intended to provide the essential modules for the 
[BioToolBox](https://github.com/tjparnell/biotoolbox) package and 
dependent modules, including 
[Bio::DB::HTS](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::DB::HTS),
[Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store),
[Bio::DB::Sam](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::DB::Sam),
[Bio::DB::BigWig](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::DB::BigWig),
[Bio::DB::BigBed](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::DB::BigBed),
and [Bio::DB::USeq](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bio::DB::USeq). 

It is sufficient for running these packages, __but not much more__. 

If you intend to use BioPerl packages or code, or other packages that use
BioPerl modules, you may better off installing the full package, not this one.

The full BioPerl package (version 1.7.8) includes 471 module files 
and 820 test files, and a fresh installation installs as many as 83
additional CPAN packages.

This minimal BioPerl package includes only 60 module files and 33 
test files, and a fresh installation will only bring 15 additional 
packages. In general, this footprint is roughly a third of the full 
installation.
